## Description
The goal of this software is to demonstrate the effectiveness of our `AltMin` and `Acc_AltMin` methods proposed in this paper for solving the square root principal component pursuit problem.

## Data
The data used in this paper consists of two parts:
- **Synthetic data**: Generated by the execution scripts in the `scripts` folder
- **Real-world data**: Primarily sourced from the dataset provided in:  
  > Chen C, Chen Q, Do MN, Koltun V (2019) Seeing Motion in the Dark. *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, 3185-3194.
The dataset is available at:  
[https://github.com/cchen156/Seeing-Motion-in-the-Dark](https://github.com/cchen156/Seeing-Motion-in-the-Dark), retrieved on January, 2024 (estimated).

Due to its size, the dataset is not included in this repository. To download and set it up, please run the following commands from the project's root directory:

```bash
# Create data directory
mkdir -p data
# Download the dataset
wget -P ./data https://storage.googleapis.com/isl-datasets/DRV/VBM4D_rawRGB.zip
# If you don't have wget, use curl:
# curl -L https://storage.googleapis.com/isl-datasets/DRV/VBM4D_rawRGB.zip -o ./data/VBM4D_rawRGB.zip
# Unzip the file and remove the archive
unzip ./data/VBM4D_rawRGB.zip -d ./data
rm ./data/VBM4D_rawRGB.zip
```
After running these commands, the required data will be located in the ./data/VBM4D_rawRGB directory.
The final directory structure should look like this:
```
./
├── data/
│   └── VBM4D_rawRGB/
│       ├── M0001/
│       ├── M0002/
│       └── ... (other scenes)
├── scripts/
└── README.md
```

## Code
This code can be run in [MATLAB R2024a](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/new_products/release2024a.html).

This directory contains the folders `src` and `scripts`:
* `src`: includes the source code of the paper. See `src/README.md` for a description of this folder. This folder is organized as follows:
  * `src/AltMin.m`: the code  for solving the square root principal component pursuit (srPCP) problem:
$$\min_{L,S} \parallel L \parallel_* + \lambda \parallel S\parallel_1 + \mu \parallel L+S-D\parallel_F$$
  by both the Alternating Minimization method (`AltMin`) and its accelerated version (`Acc_AltMin`) in the paper. `Acc_AltMin` is implemented through the same function by modifying the input `options` parameter (specifically `update_method` and `acceleration_rank`).

  * `src/UpdateL.m`: the code for updating $L$ in the paper.
  * `src/UpdateS.m`: the code for updating $S$ in the paper.
  * `src/UpdateS_sub.m`: the code for updating $S$ subproblem:
    $$\min_s \parallel s-a\parallel_2 + \lambda \parallel s\parallel_1,$$ given $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ in the paper.
* `scripts`: contains the scripts used to replicate the experiments in the paper. See the *Replicating* section below for details.


## Results
The results are presented in the numerical experiments section of the paper. 

The results are presented across multiple files containing numerical experiments and figures:

### Figure Files
* `windmill/` folder:
  - It contains image files showing decomposition results of selected frames from the windmill video dataset, presented in `Figure 1` in the paper, using the AltMin algorithm. 
  - The folder includes 15 PNG images representing different components for the 30th, 60th, and 90th frames of the video:
    - Original frames: origin30.png, origin60.png, origin90.png
    - Background components ($L$): Lbar30.png, Lbar60.png, Lbar90.png
    - Foreground components ($S$): Sbar30.png, Sbar60.png, Sbar90.png
    - Denoised images ($L+S$): LSbar30.png, LSbar60.png, LSbar90.png
    - Estimated noise components ($Z = D-L-S$): Z30.png, Z60.png, Z90.png

* `rank_identification.eps`: 
  It is `Figure 2` in the paper.
  
### Data Files
* `table1_result.txt`: Comparison of `AltMin` vs `ADMM` methods with columns:
  - method, dimension (dim), rank ($r$), noise level
  - objective value (obj), computation time (time)
  - etaL and etaS values

* `table2_result.txt`: Extended method comparison with additional columns:
  - method, parameter ($\mu$), dimension (dim), rank ($r$), noise level
  - objective value (obj), computation time (time)
  - SVD  and sorting time 
  - Includes dimensions up to 50,000
  - Shows time differences between `AltMin`, `Acc_AltMin`, and `ADMM` methods

* `table3_result.txt`: Instance-specific results with columns:
  - Name (e.g., M0008), Time, Objective value,  Iteration count, and Dimension

* `table4_result.txt`: Rank analysis with columns:
  - Name, Time, Dimension, SVD time, Sorting time, and Final rank

## Replicating


* To replicate the results in the section "Synthetic data" in the paper, please run `scripts/run_table1.m` and `scripts/run_table2.m`. The results obtained will be stored in `results` folder.
* To replicate the results in the section "Real data from dark raw videos" in the paper, please run `scripts/run_table3.m` and `scripts/run_table4.m`. The results obtained will be stored in  `results` folder.
* To replicate the result in the `Figure 1` in the paper, please run `scripts/run_fig1.m`.
* To replicate the result in the `Figure 2` in the paper, please run `scripts/run_fig2.m`.

Note: We re-implemented the code of ADMM for solving the srPCP problem, i.e., `root_pcp.m` in `scripts/root_pcp_code/` directory, based on the following paper:
